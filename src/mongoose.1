.Sh NAME
.Nm mongoose
.Nd lightweight web server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar config_file
.Nm
.Op Ar OPTIONS
.Nm
.Fl A Ar htpasswd_file domain_name user_name password
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is small, fast and easy to use web server with CGI, SSL, MD5 authorization,
and basic SSI support.
.Pp
.Nm
does not detach from terminal, and uses current working directory
as the web root, unless
.Fl r
option is specified.
It is possible to specify multiple ports to listen on. For example, to make
mongoose listen on HTTP port 80 and HTTPS port 443, one should start it as:
.Nm
.Fl s Ar cert.pem Fl p Ar 80,443s
.Pp
Unlike other web servers,
.Nm
does not expect CGI scripts to be put in a special directory. CGI scripts can
be anywhere. CGI (and SSI) files are recognized by the file extension.
.Pp
If no arguments are given,
.Nm
searches for a configuration file called "mongoose.conf" in the same directory
where mongoose binary is located. Alternatively, a file name could be
specified in the command line. Format of the configuration file is the same
as for the command line options except that each option must be specified
on a separate line, leading dashes for option names must be omitted.
Lines beginning with '#' and empty lines are ignored.

.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl A Ar htpasswd_file domain_name user_name password
Add/edit user's password in the passwords file. Deleting users can be done
with any text editor. Functionality is similar to Apache's
.Ic htdigest
utility.
.It Fl C Ar cgi_extensions
Comma-separated list of CGI extensions.  All files having these extensions
are treated as CGI scripts. Default: ".cgi,.pl,.php"
.It Fl E Ar cgi_environment
Extra environment variables to be passed to the CGI script in addition to
standard ones. The list must be comma-separated list of X=Y pairs, like this:
"VARIABLE1=VALUE1,VARIABLE2=VALUE2". Default: ""
.It Fl G Ar put_delete_passwords_file
PUT and DELETE passwords file. This must be specified if PUT or
DELETE methods are used. Default: ""
.It Fl I Ar cgi_interpreter
Use
.Ar cgi_interpreter
as a CGI interpreter for all CGI scripts regardless script extension.
Default: "". Mongoose decides which interpreter to use by looking at
the first line of a CGI script.
.It Fl M Ar max_request_size
Maximum HTTP request size in bytes. Default: "16384"
.It Fl P Ar protect_uri
Comma separated list of URI=PATH pairs, specifying that given URIs
must be protected with respected password files. Default: ""
.It Fl R Ar authentication_domain
Authorization realm. Default: "mydomain.com"
.It Fl S Ar ssi_extensions
Comma separated list of SSI extensions. Unknown SSI directives are silently
ignored. Currently, two SSI directives supported, "include" and "exec".
Default: "shtml,shtm"
.It Fl a Ar access_log_file
Access log file. Default: "", no logging is done.
.It Fl d Ar enable_directory_listing
Enable/disable directory listing. Default: "yes"
.It Fl e Ar error_log_file
Error log file. Default: "", no errors are logged.
.It Fl g Ar global_passwords_file
Location of a global passwords file. If set, per-directory .htpasswd files are
ignored, and all requests must be authorised against that file.  Default: ""
.It Fl i Ar index_files
Comma-separated list of files to be treated as directory index files.
Default: "index.html,index.htm,index.cgi"
.It Fl l Ar access_control_list
Specify access control list (ACL). ACL is a comma separated list
of IP subnets, each subnet is prepended by '-' or '+' sign. Plus means allow,
minus means deny. If subnet mask is
omitted, like "-1.2.3.4", then it means single IP address. Mask may vary
from 0 to 32 inclusive. On each request, full list is traversed, and
last match wins. Default setting is to allow all. For example, to allow only
192.168/16 subnet to connect, run "mongoose -0.0.0.0/0,+192.168/16".
Default: ""
.It Fl m Ar extra_mime_types
Extra mime types to recognize, in form
"extension1=type1,extension2=type2,...". Extension must include dot.
Example: "mongoose -m .cpp=plain/text,.java=plain/text". Default: ""
.It Fl p Ar listening_ports
Comma-separated list of ports to listen on. If the port is SSL, a letter 's'
must be appeneded, for example, "-p 80,443s" will open port 80 and port 443,
and connections on port 443 will be SSL-ed. It is possible to specify an
IP address to bind to. In this case, an IP address and a colon must be
prepended to the port number. For example, to bind to a loopback interface
on port 80 and to all interfaces on HTTPS port 443, use
"mongoose -p 127.0.0.1:80,443s". Default: "8080"
.It Fl r Ar document_root
Location of the WWW root directory. A comma separated list of
URI_PREFIX=DIRECTORY
pairs could be appended to it, allowing Mongoose to serve from multiple
directories. For example, "mongoose -p /var/www,/config=/etc,/garbage=/tmp".
Default: "."
.It Fl s Ar ssl_certificate
Location of SSL certificate file. Default: ""
.It Fl t Ar num_threads
Number of worker threads to start. Default: "10"
.It Fl u Ar run_as_user
Switch to given user's credentials after startup. Default: ""

.Sh EMBEDDING
.Nm
was designed to be embeddable into C/C++ applications. Since the
source code is contained in single C file, it is fairly easy to embed it
and follow the updates. Please refer to http://code.google.com/p/mongoose
for details.

Use /etc/cert.pem as SSL certificate file. Web root is /var/www. In addition,
